# Dijkstra's Algorithm Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, a fundamental graph search algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python.

## üìò About

Dijkstra's algorithm is commonly used in routing and network analysis. This notebook includes:

- A clear explanation of Dijkstra's algorithm
- Python implementation using a priority queue
- Visualization (if applicable)
- Example use cases with weighted graphs

## üß† Algorithm Overview

Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm works by iteratively selecting the node with the smallest tentative distance, updating the distances to its neighbors, and marking it as visited. This continues until the shortest path to all reachable nodes is found.

### Key Concepts:
- Graph representation (adjacency list or matrix)
- Priority queue for efficient minimum selection
- Distance dictionary to store shortest known distances

## üìÇ Files

- `DijkstrasProject.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing all the code and explanations.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open it in JupyterLab, VSCode, or Google Colab.
3. Run each cell in order to see the step-by-step implementation and results.

```bash
# Example (if using Jupyter Notebook)
jupyter notebook DijkstrasProject.ipynb
